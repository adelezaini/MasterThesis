 <h1 align="center">  What if Greenland was green? - exploring the climate feedbacks initiated by natural vegetation adaptation in the boreal zone </h1> <br>
 
This is my master thesis work, supervised by [Terje Koren Berntsen](https://www.mn.uio.no/geo/english/people/aca/metos/terjebe/), [Sara Marie Blichner](https://github.com/sarambl), [Trude Storevlmo](https://www.mn.uio.no/geo/english/people/aca/metos/truds/index.html), at the [UiO - University of Oslo](https://www.uio.no/english/).

ðŸš§ *It is a WIP project* ðŸš§

## Brief description
The thesis work explores the response in the atmosphere-land interactions to an expected northward vegetation shift due to climate change. Plants are expected to move to higher latitude and altitude in response to the raising temperature. This vegetation response has itself effects to the climate, initiating climatic feedbacks that lead to an overall nonlinear response of the Earth system to the initial temperature change. One of these feedbacks is the so-called vegetation-BVOC-cloud feedback, that deals with a change in atmospheric composition, presence and distribution of aerosols, formation and duration of clouds. The focus will be on the boreal zone.

## Repo organisation

- `data`*: output data of simulations run in [NorESM2](https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM) , ready to be analysed
- `notebooks` : jupyter notebooks and .py files to analyse and process data
- `processed-data`*: output files after the analysis
- `figures`: output figures
- `training`: some scripts to learn and train how to analyse modelled data
- `img`: imported images

 *data is not uploaded on the GitHub repository for storage capacity
