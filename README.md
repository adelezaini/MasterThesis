# Master Thesis: What if the Greenland was green?
### Exploring the climate feedbacks initiated by natural vegetation adaptation in the boral zone

ðŸš§ *It is a WIP project* ðŸš§

## Brief description
The thesis work explores the response in the atmosphere-land interactions to an expected northward vegetation shift due to climate change. Plants are expected to move to higher latitude and altitude in response to the raising temperature. This vegetation response has itself effects to the climate, initiating climatic feedbacks that lead to an overall nonlinear response of the Earth system to the initial temperature change. One of these feedbacks is the so-called vegetation-BVOC-cloud feedback, that deals with a change in atmospheric composition, presence and distribution of aerosols, formation and duration of clouds. The focus will be on the boreal zone.
